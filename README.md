Websites I am using to expand and master my learning of HTML and CSS

Hello, this repository is made for what it says at the start. I am learning and attempting to practice more HTML and CSS coding.
I have the ability to work on it for my job but not what I was hired for. So to hopefully help my learning stick, I will be working
on my practice here on GitHub. I will make it clear that I did not go to school for this but am simply learning using Codeacademy.

I plan on moving on to JavaScript after this however that will be awhile from now do to the slow pace I am taking in my learning.
Making sure everything sticks is my top priority, along with refining my skills as a coding "hobbiest" of sorts. I will expand on
this document more once an actual project has started.

Thanks for reading,
